No, these identifying strings are being included completely unintentionally by phishing kit creators. Oops!\n #callout { background: var(--code-bg); padding: 1.5em 1.25em; border-radius: 3px; display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 20px; } #callout-inner { margin-left: 1em; } @media (max-width: 767px) { #callout { padding: 1.5em 0.75em 1.5em 0.6em; } #callout-inner { margin-left: 0.5em; } }  📣 I’m developing a free service making it easier for defenders to get phishing sites taken down. Once you’ve detected a phishing site, try using phish.report to start getting it removed. It’ll only take you 60 seconds.   How phishing kits are born Phishing sites try to look as close as possible to the real website they target. However, most phishers don’t have the skill to actually replicate a company’s website. Instead, they take a shortcut and just clone the original website’s HTML and make some small tweaks to it.\nThe process to clone a target website and turn it into a phishing kit is roughly:\n Clone the target website using a tool like HTTrack or even just click File→Save in a web browser. Tweak the HTML to add a form asking for the victim’s personal information. Glue this together with a PHP backend to save the harvested data.  This kit can then be easily deployed onto a cheap hosting provider and be ready to collect victims' details.\nBy just copying the webpage in its entirety, the phisher gets a super realistic phishing page with very little skill or effort. But, this shortcut means their phishing page is full of things they don’t actually need.\nIn particular, any high-entropy strings in the original website are likely to accidentally end up in the final phishing kit. Which is great for us because looking for the presence of specific high-entropy strings is a very easy and reliable way to detect phishing sites.\n #callout { background: var(--code-bg); padding: 1.5em 1.25em; border-radius: 3px; display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 20px; } #callout-inner { margin-left: 1em; } @media (max-width: 767px) { #callout { padding: 1.5em 0.75em 1.5em 0.6em; } #callout-inner { margin-left: 0.5em; } }  ❓ What do I mean by “high-entropy”? I mean a string that’s long or complex enough to be unique across the entire internet. That might be because it’s random characters (e.g. 64a9e3b8) or just because it’s long enough (e.g. this sentence).   The logical question is then: why would there be high-entropy strings in the original website? It turns out that, with modern development practices, websites are full of high-entropy strings!\nSources of high-entropy strings in webpages Modern websites are rarely 100% static content. Current development practices and web security features mean there’s a range of ways that long, random strings can end up in a website. Here’s an overview of the different sources I’ve seen:\n   Entropy source Commonly seen? Entropy     Hashes in filenames Very common ≥32 bits   Version control references Common ≥32 bits   SaaS API keys Common ≥64 bits   CSRF tokens Common ≥64 bits   Content Security Policy (CSP) Nonces Uncommon ≥128 bits   Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes Uncommon ≥128 bits    1. Hashes in filenames Modern websites are often processed with a “bundler” like Webpack or Parcel that combine all the JavaScript and CSS into a single set of files. For example, a website’s sidebar.css and footer.css might get combined into a single styles.css file.\nTo ensure that browsers get the right version of these files, bundlers often include a hash in the filename. Yesterday your webpage might have used styles.64a9e3b8.css but, after updating your stylesheets, it now uses styles.a4b3a5ee.css. This change of filename forces the browser to fetch the new file rather than relying on its cache.\nBut these high-entropy filenames is exactly how a recent Royal Mail phishing kit incriminated itself. Oops!\nWhen the phisher cloned the real Royal Mail website, the HTML looked like this:\nhead  titleRoyal Mail | Royal Mail Group Ltdtitle link rel=\"stylesheet\" media=\"all\" href=\"/sites/royalmail.com/files/css/css_4WjozGK8ccMNs2W9MfwvMVZNPzpmiyysOUq4_0NulQo.css\" link rel=\"stylesheet\" media=\"all\" href=\"/sites/royalmail.com/files/css/css_o79zfvrPVtt1el1UR50-mD-0ef6IbhXxay58w8XDA0Q.css\"  head Unfortunately for the phisher, whatever technique they used to clone the website didn’t change the filenames. As a result, it’s trivial to find lots of phishing sites using CSS with this filename via urlscan.io:\n2. Version control references Any website targeted by phishers is very likely being developed by a team of people and they’re probably going to be collaborating using a version control system (VCS) for example git.\nA reasonably common choice is to embed a reference from the VCS into each build of the website. This helps with tasks like correlating bug reports to what version of the code was running at the time.\nFor example, the Monzo website embeds the git commit hash using a small JavaScript snippet:\nvar GIT_COMMIT = '444d069468754a26ff2b59495dd71b199a5d6941'; var GIT_BRANCH = 'master'; VCS references are great for blue teams because they’re so easy to look up in the version control system. If you find a phishing site that’s accidentally included a VCS reference, it’s straightforward to look up exactly when that version of the site was written (and so when the site was cloned).\n3. SaaS API keys Websites often use all sorts of 3rd party services like Intercom or reCAPTCHA. To use these services, the website usually needs to include the relevant JavaScript library as well as an API key.\nFor example, Tide use reCAPTCHA and include this snippet as part of their integration:\nscript type=\"text/javascript\" id=\"wpcf7-recaptcha-js-extra\" /* var wpcf7_recaptcha = {\"sitekey\":\"6Lclb0UaAAAAAJJVHqW2L8FXFAgpIlLZF3SPAo3w\",\"actions\":{\"homepage\":\"homepage\",\"contactform\":\"contactform\"}}; /* ]] */ script Because a reCAPTCHA “sitekey” is unique to each website, any page that contains the string 6Lclb0UaAAAAAJJVHqW2L8FXFAgpIlLZF3SPAo3w and isn’t on tide.co is very likely a cloned site.\nAlthough SaaS API keys are highly unique and make good indications, they change very infrequently and so can’t help distinguish between different phishing kits cloned from the same website. A website may use the same API key for years and so all kits created in that time would include the same key. For the same reason, API keys aren’t any help for identifying when a phishing kit was created.\n4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens Turns out lots of web security best practices also make for great phishing indicators. The most common of which is probably “Cross-Site Request Forgery” (CSRF) tokens.\nBriefly, CSRF is a vulnerability where a malicious website can trick users into performing authenticated actions on the target site. For example, this HTML creates a button that when clicked sends a POST request to https://example.com/api/delete-my-account\":\nform method=\"post\" action=\"https://example.com/api/delete-my-account\" input type=\"submit\" value=\"Click me!\" form If example.com doesn’t defend against CSRF, it will process this request and delete the unsuspecting user’s account.\nThe most common way to defend against CSRF is using a so-called CSRF token. This is a random value embedded in each webpage that the server expects to be sent back alongside sensitive requests. For example, example.com’s actual “delete my account” button could look like this:\nform method=\"post\" action=\"/api/delete-my-account\" input type=\"submit\" value=\"Click me!\" input type=\"hidden\" name=\"csrf_token\" value=\"\" form And the server would reject any request that didn’t contain the expected random value.\nCSRF tokens are excellent for detecting phishing sites because, by design, they’re unique.\n5. Content Security Policy nonces Content Security Policy (CSP) is a newer layer of security to help protect against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. It lets developers specify policies like only allowing  tags for specific domains or, more interesting for our use case, only allow  tags which include a specified “nonce”.\nTo use nonce-based CSP, a website needs to include a policy like:\nscript-src 'nonce-'; And use script tags with the matching random value:\nscript nonce=\"\" // this code is allowed to run script This helps protect against XSS attacks because the maliciously injected JavaScript won’t have a matching nonce value and so the browser will refuse to run it.\nJust like CSRF tokens, CSP nonces make for perfect phishing kit detectors: they’re designed to be unguessable so are usually long, high-entropy strings randomly generated for every request.\n6. Subresource Integrity hashes Another security feature available in modern browsers is Subresource Integrity (SRI). This protects you against maliciously modified JavaScript/CSS by allowing you to specify a hash of the expected contents. When the browser loads a JavaScript/CSS file protected with SRI, it hashes the contents and compares it against the expected hash in the HTML. If they don’t match, an error is thrown.\nAs an example, here’s how my blog uses Subresource Integrity for its CSS:\nlink href=\"https://bradleyjkemp.dev/assets/css/stylesheet.min..css\" integrity=\"sha256-+vw3Nb9LyQVDfQI46GQGsC4LuwraLFAN7UNGyt0Nzag=\" as=\"style\" This SRI hash is calculated over all the CSS on my site. As a result, although I’m using a public blog template, it’s extremely unlikely that there’s another site out there with the same hash—they’d have to be using both the exact same version of the template and have included all the same plugins.\nFor companies with much more custom websites than me, it’s practically guaranteed that no-one else’s site has exactly the same CSS.\nHow to use these high-entropy strings to fight phishing As a website developer Why not include some of the things I’ve described on your website? Even if you’re not implementing them for phishing detection benefit, many of these technologies are just best practice anyway.\nOnce phishing kits are created from your site, there’s not much you can do to stop them spreading. So, why not put in some high-entropy strings before you need them?\nAs a phishing site hunter Next time you’re analysing a phishing site, be on the lookout for some of these useful high-entropy strings.\nHashes in filenames are probably the most common example you’ll run into. These are also the most useful as you can search the filename on urlscan.io to find other instances of the same kit.\nUnfortunately, the other examples I’ve described aren’t as easily searchable at the moment. But, they still make excellent signals to classify whether a site is malicious and even which specific phishing kit it’s running.\n",

Instead, they take a shortcut and just clone the original website&rsquo;s HTML and make some small tweaks to it.</p>
<p>The process to clone a target website and turn it into a phishing kit is roughly:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the target website using a tool like HTTrack or even just click File→Save in a web browser.</li>
<li>Tweak the HTML to add a form asking for the victim&rsquo;s personal information.</li>
<li>Glue this together with a PHP backend to save the harvested data.</li>
</ol>
<p>This kit can then be easily deployed onto a cheap hosting provider and be ready to collect victims' details.</p>
<p><img src="phishing-kit-creation.png" alt="A flow chart showing firstly a real bank website, secondly a clone of the bank&rsquo;s website, and finally a tweaked clone of the bank&rsquo;s website with a form asking for personal details."></p>
<p>By just copying the webpage in its entirety, the phisher gets a super realistic phishing page with very little skill or effort.
But, this shortcut means their phishing page is full of things they don&rsquo;t actually need.</p>
<p>In particular, any high-entropy strings in the original website are likely to accidentally end up in the final phishing kit.
Which is great for us because looking for the presence of specific high-entropy strings is a very easy and reliable way to detect phishing sites.</p>

    What do I mean by &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)">high-entropy</a>&rdquo;? I mean a string that&rsquo;s long or complex enough to be unique across the entire internet. That might be because it&rsquo;s random characters (e.g. <code>64a9e3b8</code>) or just because it&rsquo;s long enough (e.g. this sentence).
  </div>
</div>
<p>The logical question is then: why would there be high-entropy strings in the original website?
It turns out that, with modern development practices, websites are full of high-entropy strings!</p>

<p>Modern websites are rarely 100% static content.
Current development practices and web security features mean there&rsquo;s a range of ways that long, random strings can end up in a website.
Here&rsquo;s an overview of the different sources I&rsquo;ve seen:</p>

<h3 id="filename-hashes">1. Hashes in filenames<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#filename-hashes">#</a></h3>
<p>Modern websites are often processed with a &ldquo;bundler&rdquo; like <a href="http://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a> or <a href="https://parceljs.org/">Parcel</a> that combine all the JavaScript and CSS into a single set of files.
For example, a website&rsquo;s <code>sidebar.css</code> and <code>footer.css</code> might get combined into a single <code>styles.css</code> file.</p>
<p>To ensure that browsers get the right version of these files, bundlers often include a hash in the filename.
Yesterday your webpage might have used <code>styles.64a9e3b8.css</code> but, after updating your stylesheets, it now uses <code>styles.a4b3a5ee.css</code>.
This change of filename forces the browser to fetch the new file rather than relying on its cache.</p>
<p>But these high-entropy filenames is exactly how a recent Royal Mail phishing kit incriminated itself.
Oops!</p>
<p>When the phisher cloned the <a href="https://royalmail.com">real Royal Mail website</a>, the HTML looked like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">head</span>&gt;

    <span style="color:#75715e">&lt;!-- snip --&gt;</span>
&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">head</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Unfortunately for the phisher, whatever technique they used to clone the website didn&rsquo;t change the filenames. As a result, it&rsquo;s trivial to find lots of phishing sites using CSS with this filename via <a href="https://urlscan.io/search/#filename:%22css_4WjozGK8ccMNs2W9MfwvMVZNPzpmiyysOUq4_0NulQo.css%22">urlscan.io</a>:</p>
<p><img src="urlscan-royalmail-results.png" alt="A screenshot of a large number of results from urlscan.io of phishing sites which include this same CSS filename."></p>
<h3 id="vcs-references">2. Version control references<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#vcs-references">#</a></h3>
<p>Any website targeted by phishers is very likely being developed by a team of people and they&rsquo;re probably going to be collaborating using a version control system (VCS) for example <code>git</code>.</p>
<p>A reasonably common choice is to embed a reference from the VCS into each build of the website.
This helps with tasks like correlating bug reports to what version of the code was running at the time.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://monzo.com">Monzo website</a> embeds the git commit hash using a small JavaScript snippet:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">GIT_COMMIT</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;444d069468754a26ff2b59495dd71b199a5d6941&#39;</span>;
<span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">GIT_BRANCH</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;master&#39;</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>VCS references are great for blue teams because they&rsquo;re so easy to look up in the version control system.
If you find a phishing site that&rsquo;s accidentally included a VCS reference, it&rsquo;s straightforward to look up exactly when that version of the site was written (and so when the site was cloned).</p>
<h3 id="saas-api-keys">3. SaaS API keys<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#saas-api-keys">#</a></h3>
<p>Websites often use all sorts of 3rd party services like <a href="https://www.intercom.com/">Intercom</a> or <a href="https://developers.google.com/recaptcha">reCAPTCHA</a>.
To use these services, the website usually needs to include the relevant JavaScript library as well as an API key.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://tide.co">Tide</a> use reCAPTCHA and include this snippet as part of their integration:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">script</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">type</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;text/javascript&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">id</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;wpcf7-recaptcha-js-extra&#34;</span>&gt;
    <span style="color:#75715e">/* &lt;![CDATA[ */</span>
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">wpcf7_recaptcha</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> {<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;sitekey&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;6Lclb0UaAAAAAJJVHqW2L8FXFAgpIlLZF3SPAo3w&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;actions&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span>{<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;homepage&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;homepage&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;contactform&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;contactform&#34;</span>}};
    <span style="color:#75715e">/* ]]&gt; */</span>
&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">script</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Because a reCAPTCHA &ldquo;sitekey&rdquo; is unique to each website, any page that contains the string <code>6Lclb0UaAAAAAJJVHqW2L8FXFAgpIlLZF3SPAo3w</code> and <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> on <code>tide.co</code> is very likely a cloned site.</p>
<p>Although SaaS API keys are highly unique and make good indications, they change very infrequently and so can&rsquo;t help distinguish between different phishing kits cloned from the same website.
A website may use the same API key for years and so all kits created in that time would include the same key.
For the same reason, API keys aren&rsquo;t any help for identifying <em>when</em> a phishing kit was created.</p>
<h3 id="csrf-tokens">4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#csrf-tokens">#</a></h3>
<p>Turns out lots of web security best practices also make for great phishing indicators.
The most common of which is probably &ldquo;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSRF">Cross-Site Request Forgery</a>&rdquo; (CSRF) tokens.</p>
<p>Briefly, CSRF is a vulnerability where a malicious website can trick users into performing authenticated actions on the target site.
For example, this HTML creates a button that when clicked sends a POST request to <code>https://example.com/api/delete-my-account&quot;</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">form</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">method</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;post&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">action</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;https://example.com/api/delete-my-account&#34;</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">input</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">type</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;submit&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">value</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Click me!&#34;</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">form</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>If example.com doesn&rsquo;t defend against CSRF, it will process this request and delete the unsuspecting user&rsquo;s account.</p>
<p>The most common way to defend against CSRF is using a so-called CSRF token.
This is a random value embedded in each webpage that the server expects to be sent back alongside sensitive requests.
For example, example.com&rsquo;s actual &ldquo;delete my account&rdquo; button could look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">form</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">method</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;post&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">action</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/api/delete-my-account&#34;</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">input</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">type</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;submit&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">value</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Click me!&#34;</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">input</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">type</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;hidden&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;csrf_token&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">value</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;&lt;randomly generated value&gt;&#34;</span>
<span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">&lt;/</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">form</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>And the server would reject any request that didn&rsquo;t contain the expected random value.</p>
<p>CSRF tokens are excellent for detecting phishing sites because, by design, they&rsquo;re unique.</p>
<h3 id="csp-nonces">5. Content Security Policy nonces<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#csp-nonces">#</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">Content Security Policy</a> (CSP) is a newer layer of security to help protect against <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting">Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</a> attacks.
It lets developers specify policies like only allowing <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags for specific domains or, more interesting for our use case, only allow <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags which include a specified &ldquo;nonce&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To use nonce-based CSP, a website needs to include a policy like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-plain" data-lang="plain">script-src &#39;nonce-&lt;random value&gt;&#39;;
</code></pre></div><p>And use script tags with the matching random value:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">script</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">nonce</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;&lt;random value&gt;&#34;</span>&gt;
    <span style="color:#75715e">// this code is allowed to run
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">script</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>This helps protect against XSS attacks because the maliciously injected JavaScript won&rsquo;t have a matching nonce value and so the browser will refuse to run it.</p>
<p>Just like CSRF tokens, CSP nonces make for perfect phishing kit detectors: they&rsquo;re designed to be unguessable so are usually long, high-entropy strings randomly generated for every request.</p>
<h3 id="sri-hashes">6. Subresource Integrity hashes<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sri-hashes">#</a></h3>
<p>Another security feature available in modern browsers is Subresource Integrity (SRI).
This protects you against maliciously modified JavaScript/CSS by allowing you to specify a hash of the expected contents.
When the browser loads a JavaScript/CSS file protected with SRI, it hashes the contents and compares it against the expected hash in the HTML.
If they don&rsquo;t match, an error is thrown.</p>
<p>As an example, here&rsquo;s how my blog uses Subresource Integrity for its CSS:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">link</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">href</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;https://bradleyjkemp.dev/assets/css/stylesheet.min.&lt;snip&gt;.css&#34;</span>
      <span style="color:#a6e22e">integrity</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;sha256-+vw3Nb9LyQVDfQI46GQGsC4LuwraLFAN7UNGyt0Nzag=&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">as</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;style&#34;</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>This SRI hash is calculated over all the CSS on my site.
As a result, although I&rsquo;m using a public blog template, it&rsquo;s extremely unlikely that there&rsquo;s another site out there with the same hash&mdash;they&rsquo;d have to be using both the exact same version of the template and have included all the same plugins.</p>
<p>For companies with much more custom websites than me, it&rsquo;s practically guaranteed that no-one else&rsquo;s site has exactly the same CSS.</p>

<h3 id="as-a-website-developer">As a website developer<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#as-a-website-developer">#</a></h3>
<p>Why not include some of the things I&rsquo;ve described on your website?
Even if you&rsquo;re not implementing them for phishing detection benefit, many of these technologies are just best practice anyway.</p>
<p>Once phishing kits are created from your site, there&rsquo;s not much you can do to stop them spreading.
So, why not put in some high-entropy strings before you need them?</p>
<h3 id="as-a-phishing-site-hunter">As a phishing site hunter<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#as-a-phishing-site-hunter">#</a></h3>
<p>Next time you&rsquo;re analysing a phishing site, be on the lookout for some of these useful high-entropy strings.</p>
<p>Hashes in filenames are probably the most common example you&rsquo;ll run into.
These are also the most useful as you can search the filename on <a href="https://urlscan.io/">urlscan.io</a> to find other instances of the same kit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the other examples I&rsquo;ve described aren&rsquo;t as easily searchable at the moment.
But, they still make excellent signals to classify whether a site is malicious and even which specific phishing kit it&rsquo;s running.</p>
